# Eat Wild!

## Description
We are Lindsey, Abby, Lisa, Riley, and Megan, and while in a coding class together, we came up with the idea to create a foraging website that would show users on which hikes they could find certain edible plants. All five of us share a love of nature and wanted to create something that people like us would be excited to use. Hike & Forage Utah is a great resource for hungry foodies who are looking for an adventure! We hope our users enjoy this as much as we did making it.

## Deployed Website
View our live page <a href="https://lindseypaluso.github.io/hikeandforageapp/">HERE</a>

## Navigating the App
**Home Page** <br>
The home page shows users a carousel of stunning images of foliage in nature. Here users can select the image of a specific plant they would like to forage, and then the results of matching hikes are displayed below. Users can also type in their zipcode to see a display of nearby hikes. Within each hike display is a picture from the hike, a brief summary, the difficulty level and distance, and a link to more information on that hike. Once a user selects their preferred hike, the "View Hike" link takes them to more specific information on how to get to that hike.

**Plants Page** <br>
This page gives detailed information on the plants highlighted on our home page as some of Utah's forageable plants. By clicking on the image of a plants, a modal pops up with a summary of that plant and a link to a recipe that users can cook once they have foraged the plant.

**Contact Page** <br>
This is a sample page of how to get in contact. Right now, the message doesn't go anywhere and there isn't actually a newsletter, but that would be a chance for future development.

**About Page** <br>
This is where we explain our motivation for creating the app.

## Future Development Ideas
As a user, I want to be able to select a hike based off crowdedness
As a user, I want to be able to select a hike based off Instagram-worthiness (ex: prettiness/view/destination)
As a user, I want to be able to locate seasonal edible plants
