# Hike and Forage Utah

This was an important step in our full-stack journey as we used all the skills and knowledge from the first third of the bootcamp to work as a group to build web application from scratch. With our team, we conceived and executed a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Because we worked collaboratively, we practiced agile development methodologies and implemented feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

Our website was awarded “Most Overall Original Concept” for connecting users with hikes to forage plants.
